# MIDI-Strings Project Description
This contains the code to operate a DSPIC30F4011-30i/p as part of a system to detect guitar string vibration, isolate the frequency and amplitude characteristics, and represent this data digitally as prescribed by the MIDI 1.0 specification. The waveform data collected from each string is completely independent, making it possible for the notes and nuances of each guitar string to be translated into MIDI data, effectively creating six separate instruments that can be used to control sound generators or many other performance parameters.

#Code Disclaimer
This project was pulled from my teams final report, and hasn't been recompiled. So there may be some formatting issues or other syntactic compiliation issues.
